# Spoofing

Use the scripts in this directory to run a spoofing attack against the physical or semi-digital twins.

The script to use depends on whether the twin is running with spoofing protection enabled or not.

With protections enabled, run:

```sh
python3 run_fixed.py
```

With protections disabled, run:

```sh
python3 run_vulnerable.py
```
